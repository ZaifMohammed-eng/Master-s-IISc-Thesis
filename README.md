This study focuses on investigating the impact of alloying elements, such as Germanium (Ge),
Silicon (Si), and Aluminium (Al), on the elastic properties of L12 structured Nickel (Ni)-based
superalloys. To analyze these effects, first-principle density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation.
The supercell employed in the calculations consisted of 24 Ni atoms along with 8 Al,8 Ge and
8Si atoms, which results in the formation of the L12 structures of 32 atoms of Ni3Al, Ni3Ge and
Ni3Si respectively. To explore the influence of Si, Ge and Al, substitutions of these atoms were
made in the X sublattice of Ni3X where X = (Al, Ge, Si), resulting in different intermediate
compositions of L12 structures. These compositions are denoted as Ni3Al(1-x)Gex , Ni3Ge(1-x)Six
and Ni3Si(1-x)Gex
The objective of this research is to develop a machine-learning (ML) model capable of
predicting the elastic properties of the intermediate compositions in Ni3Al(1-x-y)GexSiy systems,
as well as for the aforementioned intermediate compositions of L12 structures. The ML models
are trained using a feature set derived from the fingerprints of the L12 structured pseudo-binary
alloy configurations. These fingerprints are obtained through radial distribution calculations,
which provide information of nearest neighbours of bond types of Al-Al, Al-Ge, Al-Si, Si-Si,
Si- within the configurations.
By leveraging the ML models trained on the feature set, this research aims to accurately predict
the elastic properties of the intermediate compositions of interest. This predictive capability
enables a deeper understanding of the effects of alloying elements on the elastic properties of
L12 structures in Nickel-based superalloys, facilitating the design and development of
advanced materials with desired mechanical characteristics.
